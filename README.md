Introduction:

The ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) procedure is a technique of in vitro fertilization that involves injecting a single sperm directly into the egg's cytoplasm. It is a complex process that requires precise video annotation for effective analysis and understanding.

Video annotation can help in identifying key moments of the procedure, which in turn can contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the ICSI procedure.

Challenges related to video annotation of the ICSI procedure may include the need for precise identification and classification of different stages of the procedure, as well as technical challenges related to processing and analyzing video images.
